## **1. The Problem: Why Coaching Hires Matter**  
### **Current Pain Points**  
- **For Agents:**  
  - Relies on outdated networks ("Who you know") rather than data-driven fits.  
  - Misses ideal opportunities where a coach’s skills could shine.  
- **For Teams:**  
  - Overpay for "big names" while neglecting specialists who could fix key weaknesses.  
  - No way to **quantify** a coach’s impact before hiring.  

**Example:**  
- A team spends $8M/year on a HC but loses games due to poor special teams (could’ve hired a cheaper HC + elite ST coach).

## **2. The Solution: AI-Driven Coach-Team Matching**  
### **Core Features**  
1. **Three-Layer Analytics Engine**  
   - **Team/Play Data** (e.g., 3rd-down efficiency, red-zone struggles).  
   - **Coach Metrics** (e.g., historical improvement in player development).  
   - **Budget Optimization** (salary vs. projected impact).  

2. **Budget-Aware Recommendations**  
   - Suggests **cost-efficient staffing plans** (e.g., "Spend less on HC to afford an elite OC").  
   - Flags **underrated coaches** who deliver 80% of the performance at 50% the cost.  

3. **Founder’s Edge**  
   - Trains AI on **real coaching insights** (e.g., "Adaptability > win totals for rebuilding teams").

## **3. How It Works**  
### **Step-by-Step User Flow**  
1. **Agent/Team Inputs:**  
   - Coach profile (or team needs).  
   - Budget constraints.  
2. **AI Analysis:**  
   - Cross-references coaching style, team gaps, and financials.  
3. **Output:**  
   - "Top 5 Fits" with **projected performance boost** and **salary savings**.  

**Example Output:**  
> *"Team Alpha should hire HC Smith ($5M) + DC Lee ($3M) instead of HC Jones ($9M). Projected +2 wins/year and $1M savings."*
